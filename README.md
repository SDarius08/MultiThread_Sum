# Multi Thread Calculator

## The concept
MultiThread_Sum is a C project that demonstrates the use of multithreading to calculate the sum of elements in an array. By dividing the array into segments and summing each segment concurrently, the program showcases how multithreading can enhance performance in computational tasks
## The Scope
This project is designed to explore and compare the efficiency of single-threaded and multithreaded approaches to summation. It aims to:

+ Illustrate the basic principles of multithreading in C++.
+ Measure execution time differences between single-threaded and multithreaded sum computations.
+ Provide a simple yet effective demonstration of concurrent programming.

## How to run locally?
###Requirements
+ C++11 or later
+ A C++ compiler such as g++ (Linux/macOS) or MinGW (Windows)

### Steps
+ Close the repositoy:
  ```bash
  `git clone https://github.com/SDarius08/MultiThread_Sum.git | cd MultiThread_Sum
+ Run the cmake file with the command cmake
  ```bash
  cmake
  ```
+ Make the executable by running make
  ```bash
  make
  ```
